## Replace badges & logos
Place official logos (AWS, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, NESA, Burp, Python etc.) into `assets/` and keep file names like `badge-aws.png`, `badge-pci.png` etc. Ensure you have permission to use brand logos.

2. In the repo Settings → Pages, select branch `main` (or `gh-pages`) and save. Your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/`.
3. Upload your resume PDF to `assets/NAGOORBABA_SHAIK_Resume.pdf` if you want the download link to work.

## Submit to Google Search

## Notes on logos & trademarks
If you use vendor logos (AWS, PCI DSS, ISO, NESA), verify trademark/brand usage guidelines on the vendor's official site. Replace placeholder images in `/assets/` with official SVGs for best quality.
